    <string name="aboutme">Hi, my name is Mahmoud khalaf.\n\nI love fish.\n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.\nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.\n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.\nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.\n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.\n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.\nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.\n\n</string>
